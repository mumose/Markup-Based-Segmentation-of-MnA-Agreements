MarkupMnA: Markup-Based Segmentation of M&A Agreements please visit [[the new repo](https://github.com/MarkupMnA/MarkupMnA-Markup-Based-Segmentation-of-MnA-Agreements)] **


This repo contains:
- The **MarkupMnA: Markup-Based Segmentation of M&A Agreements Dataset**
- **Training** and **evaluation** code for the experiments mentioned in MarkupMnA: Markup-Based Segmentation of M&A Agreements.

## MarkupMnA Dataset
- The MarkupMnA Dataset in the contracts directory. It is divided into train, val and test 
subdirs that were used in our experiments. 
- The MarkupMnA Dataset can also be found at [[zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8034853)]

## Pretrained Models
- The various pretrained models used in our experiments can be downloaded from 
    [[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SGeSA9OLBYcpl_l0SFIjaP445KfEzcp-?usp=sharing)]

## Training

The provided code supports:
- Training the **MarkupLM base** model
- Training the **MarkupLM large** model
- Performing the **ablation experiments** mentioned in MarkupMnA: Markup-Based Segmentation of M&A Agreements
- Training on a **subset of k** contracts from the training dataset

#### Training the MarkupLM base model
```bash
python3 train.py --config=./configs/config.yaml
```

- There are different config files present in the `configs` directory. You can 
execute a job from the list above by providing the path to the config file for that 
particular job
- The output created by the above command will be saved in the `collateral dir` 
    specified in the config file. 
 

## Evaluation
To obtain performance metrics on the test set you can run 
```bash
python3 inference.py --config=./configs/config.yaml
```

**Note: Make sure to update the `predict` key in the config file before running 
this command**

We also provide a script to obtain performance metrics using
constrained decoding mentioned in MarkupMnA: Markup-Based Segmentation of M&A Agreements. You can run it using 
```bash
python3 constrained_inference.py --config=./configs/config.yaml
```
